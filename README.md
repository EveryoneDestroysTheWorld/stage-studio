# Stage Studio
Stage Studio is an upcoming Roblox plugin that transfer stage build data from the [Stage Maker](https://github.com/EveryoneDestroysTheWorld/stage-maker) to Roblox Studio, and vice versa! It will be helpful for building stages with external tools like Building Tools by F3X or including mesh parts in a stage.

Stage Studio hasn't been fully defined yet, so stay tuned to [its issue in the design repository](https://github.com/EveryoneDestroysTheWorld/design/issues/280) for updates.
