# Stage Studio
Stage Studio is an upcoming Roblox plugin that transfer stage build data from the [Stage Maker](https://github.com/EveryoneDestroysTheWorld/stage-maker) to Roblox Studio, and vice versa! It will be helpful for building stages with external tools like Building Tools by F3X or including mesh parts in a stage. It can also be helpful for developers to test game modes in Studio without having to clone the Stage Maker place.

Stage Studio hasn't been fully defined yet, so stay tuned to [its issue in the design repository](https://github.com/EveryoneDestroysTheWorld/design/issues/280) for updates.
